# Predicting Credit Risk

Machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. 

## Prediction: Linear Regression vs. Random Forest

The Random Forest will perform better as it is better at taking in multiple variables into consideration when building its model.

### Logistic Regression Results

- Training Score: 0.9921240885954051
- Testing Score: 0.9918489475856377
- Scaled Training Score: 0.638309946347503
- Scaled Testing Score: 0.6370718118035493

### Random Forest Results

- Training Score: 0.9975409272252029
- Testing Score: 0.991642591828312
- Scaled Training Score: 0.9676537350392076
- Scaled Testing Score: 0.9680664465538589

## Results

Training scores and Testing scores show that there is very little difference but Random Forest does much better once the scores are scaled.
